# User Authentication & Persistent Memory Guide

## Overview

Your Teddy Bear AI Companion now supports multiple users with persistent conversation memory! Each user has their own account and personal teddy bear that remembers all previous conversations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Authentication
- **Registration**: Create a new account with username and password
- **Login**: Securely log in to access your personal teddy bear
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (never stored in plain text)

### 2. Persistent Conversation Memory
- **Auto-Save**: Every message is automatically saved to the database
- **History Loading**: When you log in, all previous conversations are loaded
- **Per-User Storage**: Each user has their own separate conversation history
- **Clear History**: Option to clear conversation history with confirmation

### 3. Database Structure
- **SQLite Database**: Lightweight, file-based database (`teddy_bear.db`)
- **Users Table**: Stores user accounts (id, username, password_hash, created_at)
- **Messages Table**: Stores all conversation messages (id, user_id, role, content, timestamp)

## How to Use

### First Time Setup

1. Make sure you have your `.env` file with your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python chat_cli.py
   ```

3. Choose option `2` to register a new account:
   - Enter a username (minimum 3 characters)
   - Enter a password (minimum 6 characters)
   - Confirm your password

### Logging In

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python chat_cli.py
   ```

2. Choose option `1` to login:
   - Enter your username
   - Enter your password

3. Your teddy bear will greet you and load your conversation history!

### Chat Commands

Once logged in, you can use these commands:
- Type normally to chat with your teddy bear
- `clear` - Clear all conversation history (asks for confirmation)
- `quit` or `exit` or `bye` - End the session

## Architecture

### File Structure
```
bear/
â”œâ”€â”€ chat_cli.py              # Main CLI application
â”œâ”€â”€ database.py              # Database models and setup
â”œâ”€â”€ auth.py                  # Authentication functions
â”œâ”€â”€ conversation_manager.py  # Conversation persistence
â”œâ”€â”€ teddy_bear.db           # SQLite database (auto-created)
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt        # Dependencies
```

### New Dependencies
- `sqlalchemy>=2.0.0` - ORM for database operations
- `bcrypt>=4.0.0` - Password hashing and verification
