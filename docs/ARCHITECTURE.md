# Architecture Overview

## System Design Philosophy
Start simple, scale smart - building with a focus on simple, **isolated** components with room for scalability

## Technology Choices

### Anthropic Claude API + LangChain

I used Anthropic's Claude API through the LangChain framework for our conversational AI layer:

#### Why Claude?
- **Conversational Quality**: Claude demonstrates superior personality consistency and empathetic responses compared to alternatives, essential for a companion users will interact with daily
- **Safety**: Built-in safety features reduce risk of harmful or inappropriate responses in an emotionally-sensitive context
- **Context Window**: 200K token context allows us to maintain extensive conversation history and user memories without truncation
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Claude Sonnet provides excellent quality-to-cost ratio, important for scaling to multiple users

#### Why LangChain?
- **Abstraction Layer**: Provides prompt templates, memory management, and conversation chains out-of-the-box, accelerating development
- **Memory Management**: Built-in conversation memory and vector store integration simplifies our persistent memory system
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for memory recall, tool calling for bear actions, and streaming for real-time responses
- **Production Ready**: Includes logging, retry logic, rate limiting, and error handling needed for production deployment
- **Future-Proofing**: Model-agnostic design allows us to switch providers or run A/B tests with minimal code changes


### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind was selected to accelerate UI development while maintaining design consistency:

- **Development Velocity**: Utility-first approach enables rapid prototyping, critical for our one-month sprint
- **Built-in Design System**: Ensures visual consistency across components without manual design token creation
- **Responsive by Default**: Mobile-first utilities make it trivial to support all device sizes
- **Performance**: PurgeCSS integration keeps bundle sizes minimal for faster load times
- **Animation Integration**: Works seamlessly with Framer Motion for smooth bear animations and interactions

### SQL Lite
- serverless: for a small scale web application, having a highly portable database is more efficient and works sufficiently well for key features
- simplicity: project does not require complex database features as I will not be indexing for specific data frequently

### Memory System Design
1. Working memory - stores current conversation context using LRU cache
2. Semantic memory - stores personal details, preferences, relationships using definitions
